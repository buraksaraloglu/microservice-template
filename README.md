A microservice template using [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/), [Fastify](https://fastify.io/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Developing

### Built With

- [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Fastify](https://fastify.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### Prerequisites

What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.

### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/buraksaraloglu/microservice-template.git
cd microservice-template
npm install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
npm build
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing

For the deployment of the project,

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags).

## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when using the project.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

## Style guide

Explain your code style and show how to check it.

## Api Reference

If the api is external, link to api documentation. If not describe your api including authentication methods as well as explaining all the endpoints with their required parameters.

## Database

Explaining what database (and version) has been used. Provide download links.
Documents your database design and schemas, relations etc...

## Licensing

State what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
